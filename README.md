# Documentation

## Overview
This repository contains research reports on two tensile machines, along with an in-depth Technical Advisory Committee (TAC) Report. These documents serve as exemplars of the professional and thorough documentation I have undertaken.


## Reports 

### Tensile Machine Research Reports

**Description:** 
The Tensile Machines Research report was initiated after the DigitMakers CEO inquired about the feasibility of creating an inexpensive tensile measuring device for 3D printed specimens. The purpose of these documents is to provide a brief analysis of the tensile machines capabilities, applications, pricing, and technical considerations.

- **Report 1: Electric Tensile Machine**
  - **Contents:** 
    - **Technical Summary**: Design and capabilities for various tests and data analysis.
    - **Materials and Cost**: Detailed cost estimates for essential components.
    - **Timeline**: Critical stages of component acquisition, assembly, and software setup.
    - **Electronics and Wiring**: Setup involving motor drivers, microcontrollers, and power supply.
    - **Software Installation and Testing**: Installing Arduino code and conducting initial tests.
    - **Safety Check and Risk Assessment**: Importance of safety and potential assembly and operation risks.
  - **Date**: November 2023.

- **Report 2: Mechanical Tensile Machine**
  - **Contents:** 
    - **Technical Summary**: Manual operation using a hydraulic jack and crane scale for force measurement.
    - **Materials and Cost**: Estimates for metal rods, steel plates, hydraulic jack, digital crane scale, etc.
    - **Timeline**: Estimated times for component acquisition, assembly, calibration, and testing.
    - **Frame Assembly**: Steps for assembling the base and upper frames using metal bars and steel plates.
    - **Safety and Stability Checks**: Procedures for ensuring device integrity and operational safety.
    - **Testing and Calibration**: Testing the mechanical fixture and hydraulic jack; calibration process.
    - **Risk Assessment**: Identifying and mitigating potential risks like mechanical failure and inaccuracies.
  - **Date**: November 2023.

### Technical Advisory Committee (TAC) Report

**Description:**
The Detailed TAC Report, crafted by an Agile development team, is specifically tailored for the EXPLOREBOOKING website, which allows users to share and discover unique travel spots known to locals. This comprehensive report encompasses a thorough analysis of all aspects of the final product.

- **TAC Report: ExploreBooking - A Web Application for Travel**
  - **Contents:** 
    - **User-Centric Design**: Focus on understanding and meeting the needs of travelers, post writers, and administrators.
    - **Quality Assurance**: Emphasis on rigorous testing and schedules to ensure application reliability and user satisfaction.
    - **Iterative Development**: Agile development process indicated by progress monitoring and iteration tables.
    - **Technical and Functional Scope**: Delineation of the application's capabilities and testing parameters.
  - **Date**: April 2023.
